***Dynamical systems*** are encountered within nature through various conformal representations ranging from physical phenomena such as turbulence to bacteria population dynamics to financial investment dynamics to the movement of extraterrestrial planets, etc. The common denominator in all these mutually exclusive examples is the *dependence on time (either discrete or continuous)* and the evolution of their respective degrees of freedom (DOFs) with time. However, the underlying governing equations that dictate this evolution aren’t always readily accessible or are computationally expensive endeavours. This necessitates the exploration of autonomous data-driven algorithms. There have been significant strides in the development of classical computing hardware and, in recent years, quantum computing hardware, which further accelerates the development of these algorithms. This is where the core of my research lies !

## 1. Deep learning and Chaotic dynamical systems
Chaotic systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to the initial conditions, which makes it a challenging problem coupled with the range of spatio-temporal characteristics exhibited by the system. These complexities in the dynamics of forecasting/prediction of complex systems are often encountered in various scientific disciplines and are also in their nascent stages for the exploration of machine learning as the gateway. The universality of the deep-learning framework being able to approximate a continuous function (within a specified range) in such cases, i.e. time series problems, raises the idea of being able to formulate an autonomous dynamical system. Hence, so far I have explored the following:

### (MSc Thesis @ Imperial College London) Quantum gated recurrent neural networks  

I am currently investigating Quantum machine learning algorithms and their ability to tackle chaotic dynamical systems in a *teacher forced setting*. The work introduces Quantum LSTMs and Quantum GRUs. So far we benchmarked these model on a simple yet tricky toy problem, i.e. sine trigonometric function, which was used as a benchmark to generalize the comparison from an interpretability standpoint. The better *expressiveness* of the quantum versions of LSTMs & GRUs was observed with faster convergence, robustness to the varying level of gaussian noise within data and way less parameter count compared to classical versions to achieve same MSE loss with the constraint on epochs.

### Classical gated recurrent neural networks - An autonomous dynamical system !

In this work classical deep-learning frameworks, i.e. gated recurrent neural networks (LSTMs & GRUs) were used to formulate an autonomous chaotic dynamical system. The chaotic dynamical systems used for this purpose were Lorenz'63 and Lorenz'96 system. A novel methodical foundation was laid out for the architectural design of the problem statement, and robust hyper-parameters optimization was carried out via [Recycle validation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608021001969) and Bayesian optimization with [TPE sampling](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/samplers/generated/optuna.samplers.TPESampler.html#optuna.samplers.TPESampler). The methodology proposed was tested extensively for various metrics, i.e. accurate predictions of (i) the *probability density functions (PDFs)* of the DOFs, (ii) spectral properties visualized via *Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)* analysis, (iii) Capturing of the *Prediction horizon* in terms of the first few *Lyapunov times* and the stability of the chaotic system in terms of the (iv) *Leading Lyapunov exponent* computation. The outcomes of the research will be published soon !

## 2. Deep learning and Reduced order models (ROMs)

Physics based high-fidelity predictions demand high spatio-temporal resolutions, which often leads to the mathematical modeling of large scale complex non-linear phenomenas into a high degree of freedom (DOF) dynamical system. However, conventional numerical methods used to develop dicretized solutions, give rise to increased utilization of computational resources which is often prohibitive. Hence, one of the objectives of my research is to develop deep learning based models that project these high-dimensional space to a lower dimensional space/manifold, wherein the reduced representation is the projection of the large scale physical features, with minimum loss.

### State estimation using deep learning - Leveraging reduced order models (ROMs)  
State estimation problems are one of the paramount application areas, that is well-established in fluid mechanics, and is often used in the applied subjects of
design optimization and active flow control. In this work we try to leverage reduced order models (ROMs) as an effecient mediator to protect loss of information and a computational cheaper alternative. In this work, we proposed a novel deep learning-based state estimation framework that learns from sequential sensory data placed around the circumference of the 2D cylinder. A feedforward neural network based auto-encoder was used as an ROM to project high-dimensional space to the low-order manifold where LSTMs are used for the teacher-forced evolution of the low-order manifold taking sequential sensory data as input. More details about this work can be found [[here]](https://pranavsciml.github.io/publication/JCP_Y2022).

### Deep learning based effecient data-driven reduced-order model (ROMs) for temporal evolution
In this work we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (deep learning—reduced order modeling) which is based on a 3D-Unet convolution network capable of performing non-linear projections to reduced order states which is further projected back to the future state of the system, thereby forming a dynamical system. Conventionally ROMs in the literature focussed on linear projection of the higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using dimensionality reduction techniques which often results in loss of information. However, in this work we show, DL-ROM can create highly accurate reconstructions from the low-order manifold and is thus able to efficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned reduced state. More details about this work can be found [[here]](https://pranavsciml.github.io/publication/POF_Y2021)
