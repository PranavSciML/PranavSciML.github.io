Pranav Bahl is currently a master's student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where he currently exploring Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and latent diffusion models utilizing tensor network latent spaces and Data assimilation for dynamical systems via kalman filtering. Previously he completed his master's degree from the Dept. of Aeronautics, Imperial College London (ICL) in concentration Advanced Computational Methods for Aeronautics, Fluid mechanics and Fluid-structure interaction. At Imperial, he primarily explored autonomous data-driven chaotic dynamical systems utilizing classical and quantum recurrent neural networks. His graduate level courseworks ranged from Turbulence/Turbulence modeling, Multidsciplinary Optimization, Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to Machine learning/Artificial intelligence, Linear systems theory and Computational linear algebra. He completed his bachelor’s from the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Delhi Technological University (DTU). During his bachelor's degree he was primarily interested in exploring Deep learning based Reduced order models (ROMs) for large scale, physics-based high-fidelity simulations either for autonmous evolution of discretized PDEs or for the state-estimation problems. Pranav’s interests lies in the intersection of Data assimilation, Deep learning and Optimization algorithms, where he aims to enhance interpretability of these black-box models with applications pertaining to complex high-order physical phenomena, since scientific computing architectures alone cannot be relied upon to be used as a black-box with little or no information of the principles behind the physics of the problems.
